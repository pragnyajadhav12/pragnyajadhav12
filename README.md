### 👩‍💻 Who Am I?

🧠 A curious brain from **GRIET, Hyderabad**, chasing meaningful tech and real-world problem solving.  
🎯 Currently leveling up my skills for **placements** and grabbing **internship opportunities** like a pro gamer catching XP.  
💡 I don’t just code — I **create**, **debug**, **fail fast**, and **learn faster**.  
💬 Whether it’s Java or JavaScript, DBMS or debugging, I’m all in.

### 🔥 Current Mode: Code. Coffee. Conquer.

- 🌱 Learning & building with **MERN Stack**
- 📚 Solving DSA like puzzles, one test case at a time  
- 🔍 Exploring APIs, system design, and full-stack flows  
- ⚙️ Creating things that *work*, not just compile
